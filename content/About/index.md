# Who am I?

I am a software developer studying at DigiPen, with a focus on game-engine developoment and related fields. I spend most of my time on various projects, and trying to pass my classes. 

Things that ~~I think~~ I know what I'm talking about in:
- ECS
- Rendering
- Data Access
- Game Tools
    
Reach me on discord @electrp.
