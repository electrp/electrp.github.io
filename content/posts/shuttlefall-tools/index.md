## Statistics tracker

Statistics for each individual session are automatically saved to a CSV file, and can be reloaded into the tool to see data at a particular time.

This is a re-implementation of a Godot tool I had made for a separate project to track values that must keep track of multiple modifiers.
- Values are stored within accessible text files, but can also be modified and saved directly from the tool
